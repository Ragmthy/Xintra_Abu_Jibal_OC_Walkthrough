A walkthrough on solving the Abu Jibal OC Lab from Xintra

# XINTRA LABS (Abu Jibal OC)
Creating a Repository of Walkthrough for Abu Jibal OC Lab created by [XINTRA](https://www.xintra.org/). 

A fourth XINTRA lab attempted, the goal of this repository is to document my notes and thought processes for each section like I've done so for my previous ones. 
Full innovation credits for this lab goes to [XINTRA's team](https://www.xintra.org/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20our%0AExperienced%20Trainers) and other respective [contributors](https://www.xintra.org/labs#:~:text=BEHIND%20THE%20LAB-,Lab%20Contributors,-Each%20lab%20is). 

More information about the labs can be found [here](https://www.xintra.org/labs).

## Repo:
